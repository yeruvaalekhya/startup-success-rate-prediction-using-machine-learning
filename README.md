Startup Success Rate Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview

Startups face uncertainty, and most struggle to survive beyond their initial years. This project aims to predict the success rate of startups by analyzing key factors such as funding, location, sector, and growth indicators using machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist entrepreneurs, investors, and stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering on startup dataset.

Implementation of multiple ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Model comparison based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization of insights such as funding trends, sector performance, and geographical impact.

Prediction module to evaluate whether a startup is likely to succeed or fail.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Dataset

The dataset contains startup-related features such as:

Funding amount

Sector/Industry

Location

Team size

Year of operation

Status (Success/Failure)

(Dataset can be replaced with any public startup dataset or custom dataset.)

How to Run

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open Jupyter Notebook and run startup_prediction.ipynb

jupyter notebook


Run all cells to preprocess data, train models, and test predictions.

ðŸ“Š Results

Achieved XX% accuracy with [best-performing algorithm].

Random Forest/XGBoost performed better in handling imbalanced classes.

Key factors like funding amount, sector, and team size were strong predictors of success.

Future Enhancements
Use deep learning models for improved predictions.

Integrate with a web app for real-time startup success prediction.

Expand dataset with global startup records for better generalization.
